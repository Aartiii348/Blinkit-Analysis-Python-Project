Outlet_Establishment_Year

Item_Rating

**4. KPI Requirements**

Total Sales -	Total revenue generated from all items sold

Average Sales -	Average revenue per sale

Number of Items -	Total count of unique items sold

Average Rating - Mean customer rating of items

**5. Charts & Visual Requirements**

**1. Total Sales by Fat Content – Donut Chart**

Objective: Understand how fat content influences total sales.
